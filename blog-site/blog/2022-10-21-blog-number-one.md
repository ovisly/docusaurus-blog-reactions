Upon waking up after a troublesome dream one morning, Gregor Zamza realized that
he had turned into a hideous insect.

Lying on a hard shell that was now his back, he saw, with a mere move of his
head, his brown, bulgy, scaly stomach, on top of which lied a blanket that was
clearly about to fall down. His numerous, pathetically thin, compared to the
rest of his body, legs floundered helplessly in front of his eyes.

_-- "The Metamorphisis", by Franz Kafka_
